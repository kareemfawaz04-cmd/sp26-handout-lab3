## (Answer before group discussion) Stakeholder-value Matrix

Last week, we discussed privacy for people whose data might be in the contents of the 311 calls. This week, your assignment is to build a stakeholder-value matrix for your sorting criteria.

Part of Homework 3 requires you to determine appropriate "urgency rankings" for at least 10 categories. A higher ranking indicades more urgency.

1. Please write your urgency rankings here:

_Replace this with a list of at least 10 categories, each of which is assigned an urgency ranking number_


2. Then, please write a stakeholder-value matrix for your urgency ranking system with at least three values and three stakeholders. You may replace the contents of the table below.

|  | Value 1 | Value 2 | Value 3 |
| - | - | - | - |
| Stakeholder 1 |  |  |  |
| Stakeholder 2 |  |  |  |
| Stakeholder 3 |  |  |  |


3. Then, please answer these questions. You will need to have done the visualization part of Homework 3 to answer them, but the group discussion below does not require you to have answered these questions.
   
   1. Based on your bar graph of cases that remain open longer than average (per neighborhood), which stakeholders are prioritized by the system, and who is de-prioritized?
   
   2. Can the scatterplot of case locations mislead someone? What would someone take away as the "main point" if they saw your scatterplot with no other context?


## (Answer after group discussion) Comparing priorities

1. Who are some stakeholders that you prioritized in your urgency ranking, which others chose to de-prioritize? How is that reflected in both your urgency rankings?

2. Who are some stakeholders that others prioritized in their urgency rankings, which you chose to de-prioritize? How is that reflected in both your urgency rankings?
