## (Answer before group discussion) Stakeholder-value Matrix

Last week, we discussed privacy for people whose data might be in the contents of the 311 calls. This week, your assignment is to build a stakeholder-value matrix for your sorting criteria.

Part of Homework 3 requires you to determine appropriate "urgency rankings" for at least 10 categories. A higher ranking indicades more urgency. Please write your urgency rankings here:

_Replace this with a list of at least 10 categories, each of which is assigned an urgency ranking number_


Then, please write a stakeholder-value matrix for your urgency ranking system with at least three values and three stakeholders. You may replace the contents of the table below.

|  | Value 1 | Value 2 | Value 3 |
| - | - | - | - |
| Stakeholder 1 |  |  |  |
| Stakeholder 2 |  |  |  |
| Stakeholder 3 |  |  |  |

2. Who are some stakeholders that others prioritized in their urgency rankings, which you chose to de-prioritize? How is that reflected in both your urgency rankings?
